# FuseMeetupDemo

This is an excerpt from the original post I made about [our 7th MeCoDe meetup](https://www.meetup.com/MeCoDe/events/237549055/) which was about getting started with [Fuse](https://www.fusetools.com/).

+ Download Fuse from their [download page](https://www.fusetools.com/downloads) and install it - it works on both Windows and Mac
+ When you run Fuse you'll see this screen ![](http://i.imgur.com/L29CFr0.png)
+ Select `New`, name your project and click `OK`: ![](http://i.imgur.com/0zPAEbS.png)
+ Click on `Open in Sublime` (_I'm guessing that if you don't have Sublime Text, some other editor will be shown as default here_): ![](http://i.imgur.com/fqOdUDe.png) and you should see something like this: ![](http://i.imgur.com/WBhYUm3.png)
+ In your Fuse dashboard click on `Start app preview` and then just confirm the `Local` option and click `OK`: ![](http://i.imgur.com/NjZOTNN.png) you should get this screen open up: ![](http://i.imgur.com/NjZOTNN.png)
+ If you tap and hold the rectangle this is what should happen: <img src="http://i.imgur.com/oiTwuaN.gifv" />
+ Now, few examples with code and expected output: ![](http://i.imgur.com/Z0nXkrS.png) ![](http://i.imgur.com/DirN4Sz.png) ![](http://i.imgur.com/rOrkAye.png)
